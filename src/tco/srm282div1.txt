Problem Statement
    
You will be given a list of numbers, and a target average. Compute the value of one additional number to add to the list, such that the average value of the new list is equal to target.
For example, given the list of numbers { 3.0, 7.0, 2.5 } and the target average 4.5, you would have to add the number 5.5 to the list because (3.0 + 7.0 + 2.5 + 5.5) / 4 = 4.5.
