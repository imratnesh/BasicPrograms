Problem Statement
    
A company wants to generate cost advantage by bundling its products, which means that several products are sold in a package. In order to compose bundles optimally, the company has collected data about which products were bought from customers.
Your company produces n products. You will be given a String[] data, each element of which contains exactly n characters. The jth character of element i of data will be '1' if customer i bought product j, and '0' otherwise. Two products can be in the same bundle only if every customer bought neither of them or both of them. It is possible for a bundle to contain just one product. Return the minimum number of bundles into which the products can be partitioned. Note that every product must be put in some bundle.
